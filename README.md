# Comparing string processing performance of programming languages

... using a simple bioinformatics task: Computing the GC fraction of DNA.

## Usage

```
make all
cat report.csv
```

## More info

This is a continuation of a previous benchmarking project, covered in [this blog post](http://saml.rilspace.com/moar-languagez-gc-content-in-python-d-fpc-c-and-c).

Note that we put a requirement on all codes here, to read all data line by
line.  This is since DNA/RNA data often is too large to load into memory, and
so we have this simple rule in order to make codes from a wide variety of
languages to be somewhat comparable.

## Current results

These are some results from running the tests in the Makefile, on my Lenovo
ThinkPad Yoga with an Intel i5 4210U @ 1.7GHz (2.7GHz Max) and 8GB RAM, on
Xubuntu 16.04 LTS 64bit:

| Language  | Execution time (ms) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| C         |               0.176 |
| Go        |               0.240 |
| D         |               0.303 |
| C++       |               0.380 |
| Nim       |               0.513 |
| FPC       |               0.517 |
| PyPy      |               0.520 |
| Cython    |               1.570 |
| Python    |               2.217 |

## Acknowledgements

I got tons of help with the [previous blog post](http://saml.rilspace.com/moar-languagez-gc-content-in-python-d-fpc-c-and-c),
and I'm afraid I might miss to mention some people here who have helped out,
but see the below list as an (incomplete) start at collecting contributors, and
feel free to add any missing info, including yourself, here.

## Incomplete list of contributions

- Daniel Sp√•ngberg (working at UPPMAX HPC center at the time) contributed
  numerous, extremely fast implementations in C, including the one above
  (c.000), which is constrained by the requirement to process the file line by
  line.
- [Roger Peppe](https://github.com/rogpeppe)
  ([twitter](https://twitter.com/rogpeppe)) contributed the fastest Go
  implementation, including pointers in combination with a table lookup.
- [Mario Ray Mahardhika (aka leledumbo)](https://github.com/leledumbo)
  contributed the fastest FreePascal implementation, which is the one above
  (fpc.000).
- [Harald Achitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harald-achitz-860657139/)
  provided the C++ implementation used above (cpp.000).
- (Who is missing here?)
